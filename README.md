# Python-Sample-App-Part-Three
Part Three of the Python Sample App for DTS L7 CETM65: Software Engineering Principles

Here we have further extracted out menu functionality into their own methods e.g. print_main_menu()

We have also added docstrings to modules, functions and classes to provide documentation on their functionality.

We have added a ***rentals*** module to contain everything related to vehicle rentals and imported to main module.

Instructions:

  1. Clone the repo
  2. Run code with:
    ``` python main.py ```
